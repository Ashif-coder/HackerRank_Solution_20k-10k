# Feedback on Code Review


The feedback on the code review conducted by Amal regarding the "Max-Min" problem. I appreciate Amal's constructive feedback and have
made the necessary corrections and improvements to the code. 

## Here is a summary of the feedback and the corresponding changes made:

    - Use of float('inf'): Amal recommended finding an alternative way to set the initial value for min_unfairness instead of using min_unfairness = float('inf').
       In response, I updated the code to use min_unfairness = arr[k - 1] - arr[0], which is a more memory-efficient way to initialize min_unfairness.

    - Sorting the Array: Amal suggested finding a way to solve the problem without sorting the array. While I explored this, it turned out that the most optimal
       solution still involves sorting the array. Sorting is essential for this problem, and I retained this approach.

    - Code Comments for Readability: Amal emphasized the importance of including comments in the code for better readability. I have addressed this by adding comments to the code,
       providing explanations for various parts of the program. This will help make the code more understandable and maintainable.

## Modified Code
```
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

#
# Complete the 'maxMin' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER k - the size of the subarray.
#  2. INTEGER_ARRAY arr - the input array.

def maxMin(k, arr):
    # Sort the input array to ensure elements are ordered
    arr.sort()
    
    # Initialize min_unfairness with the difference between the kth largest and the smallest element
    min_unfairness = arr[k - 1] - arr[0]

    # Iterate through the sorted array to find the minimum unfairness
    for i in range(len(arr) - k + 1):
        unfairness = arr[i + k - 1] - arr[i]
        min_unfairness = min(min_unfairness, unfairness)

    return min_unfairness

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    n = int(input().strip())
    k = int(input().strip())

    arr = []

    for _ in range(n):
        arr_item = int(input().strip())
        arr.append(arr_item)

    result = maxMin(k, arr)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()

```

I appreciate Amal's input, and the code now incorporates these improvements to enhance its clarity and efficiency. I believe these changes have positively impacted the code quality and readability.
